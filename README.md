# BeatBoxd - Everyone's a critic!
If everyone's a critic-  why not share your opinion?

#### Colour Scheme:

- #1f0a1c
- #dbf1fa
- #7f4b91
- #411f2a
- #de643b

I used Coolors to help me workshop the overall colour scheme of BeatBoxed. After many iterations and testing the colours out in [Realtime Colors](https://www.realtimecolors.com/?colors=1f0a1c-dbf1fa-7f4b91-411f2a-de643b&fonts=Monoton-Truculenta), I eventually settled on the current colour scheme.
